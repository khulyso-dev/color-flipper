# Color Flipper Project

This project consists of three HTML files (`index.html`, `hex.html`, `rgb.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and three JavaScript files (`app.js`, `hex.js`, `rgb.js`). It provides a color flipper functionality where the background color of the webpage changes upon user interaction.

## HTML Files

### `index.html`

This file represents the main page of the color flipper project. It includes a navigation bar, a container for displaying the background color, and a button for triggering the color change. The color is displayed as a color name. This file references the `style.css` file for styling and the `app.js` file for the color flipper logic.

### `hex.html`

This file represents a variation of the color flipper project that displays the color in hexadecimal format. It shares the same structure as `index.html` but references the `hex.js` file instead of `app.js` for the color flipper logic.

### `rgb.html`

This file represents another variation of the color flipper project that displays the color in RGB format. It follows the same structure as `index.html` but references the `rgb.js` file instead of `app.js` for the color flipper logic.

## CSS File

### `style.css`

This file contains the styles for the color flipper project. It defines the styling for the navigation bar, container, button, footer, and other elements present in the HTML files.

## JavaScript Files

### `app.js`

This file contains the JavaScript code for the color flipper functionality used in `index.html`. It defines an array of color names, generates a random color upon button click, and updates the background color and color name displayed on the page. It also includes functions for opening and closing the navigation sidebar.

### `hex.js`

This file contains the JavaScript code for the color flipper functionality used in `hex.html`. It defines an array of hexadecimal values, generates a random hexadecimal color upon button click, and updates the background color and hexadecimal color displayed on the page. It also includes functions for opening and closing the navigation sidebar.

### `rgb.js`

This file contains the JavaScript code for the color flipper functionality used in `rgb.html`. It defines an array of RGB values, generates a random RGB color upon button click, and updates the background color and RGB color displayed on the page. It also includes functions for opening and closing the navigation sidebar.

## Usage

To use the color flipper project, open any of the HTML files (`index.html`, `hex.html`, `rgb.html`) in a web browser. Clicking the "click me" button will trigger a random color change in the background, and the color name or value will be displayed accordingly.

The navigation bar provides links to switch between the different color flipper variations (`Random`, `Hex`, `RGB`). Clicking the hamburger icon in the navigation bar opens a sidebar menu, allowing easy navigation between the different pages.
